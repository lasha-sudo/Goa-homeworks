    <p>The HTML main tag is a str    uctural element that represents the main content of a document. It's like the central hub of your webpage, encapsulating the primary content. By    wrapping your main content within this tag, you're signaling to browsers and developers that this is the core information users are seeking.</p>

        The article element identifies a self-contained piece of content which could theoretically be distributed to other websites and platforms as a stand-alone unit. The <article> element is a good choice to contain entire blog posts, news articles, and similar content.
